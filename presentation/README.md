1. Please find attached for the finalized pdfs (including our workshop program) for your reference.  These will be part of AMTA 2018 proceedings and be available in ACL Anthology.

2. In addition to the work you will be presenting in the workshop, it might also be beneficial to have a few slides to introduce to your audiences the status of the language(s) you are working on.

2-1. General status of the language(s): population of native and as-second-language speakers, writing systems, etc.
2-2. What corpora do we have in these languages?  Parallel/comparable corpora?  Monolingual corpora?
2-3. Are there MT systems available?  How do they perform?
2-4. What are the pre-processing and post-processing tools used for MT?
2-5. Are there NLP tools (POS tagger, parsers, segmenters, morphology analyzers etc.) we could be using for these languages?  Are they open sourced?
2-6. Are the languages in danger?  What are the urgent needs from research communities for these languages?
2-7. Is there any problem dealing with the writing systems of the languages?  For example, different writing systems for one language.

3. Please do feel free if you would like to seek comments/suggestions from your reviewers on the slides.  I will forward the file to them and get back to you asap.
