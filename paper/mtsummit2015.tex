\begin{abstract}
  A comparison of supervised and unsupervised \ac{NMT} models was done for the corpora provided by the DeepHack.Babel competition.
  It is shown that for even small parallel corpus, fully supervised \ac{NMT} gives better results than fully unsupervised for the case of constrained domain of the corpus.
  We have also implemented a recent fully unsupervised \ac{NMT} model which has given good final results.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}

We present results obtained by the "NL~Processing" team during the DeepHack.Babel hackathon~\footnote{\url{http://babel.tilda.ws/}} on semi-supervised machine translation.
Organizers of the competition created an oblivious setup - a case in which the source and target languages are not known and the machine translation system can be trained with no specific tuning to the language pair.
The scoring system would run training and then run translation with the trained model.
Participants have no insight into the process and could only observe the final score for a submission and/or the failure status.
Submissions were scored in BLEU-4~\citep{papineni2002bleu}.

For each language pair the following datasets~\footnote{\url{http://contest.deephack.me/c/babel/overview}} were available:
\begin{itemize}
  \item each language of a pair has one monolingual corpora, {\tt 1M} sentences;
  \item a small parallel corpus, {\tt 50K} sentence pairs;
  \item and an input corpus to be translated from source to target language, {\tt 6K} sentences.
\end{itemize}
There were 3 language pairs used during the competition: {\tt En-Ru} for test, {\tt Lv-En} for qualification and {\tt En-Ko} for final scoring.
More information about corpora is available in Section~\ref{sect:data}.

The machine translation system could be built as a fully supervised one, though the parallel corpus is small ({\tt 50K}); as an unsupervised one, using the two monolingual corpora; and as a semi-supervised one.
Our solutions followed the fully supervised and fully unsupervised approaches only.

Given the problem at hand, the paper devises a number of baseline approaches and then compare them to the unsupervised model described above.
Section~\ref{sect:baseline} will outline the baselines which were used to benchmark the unsupervised \ac{NMT} in the oblivious setup.
In Section~\ref{sect:unmt} we discuss the experiments with the unsupervised \ac{NMT} model for the oblivious setup.
Finally, in Section~\ref{sect:nonoblivious} we investigate whether prior knowledge of a language pair gives an advantage for the unsupervised \ac{NMT} approach.

\section{Baseline}
\label{sect:baseline}

A supervised \ac{NMT} model~\footnote{For a full description of the Encoder-Decoder architecture see \url{https://github.com/aoboturov/loresmt-nlprocessing\#supervised-model-description}.} was chosen for the baseline.
The model was implemented in OpenNMT~\citep{opennmt} and had the following Encoder-Decoder architecture:
\begin{itemize}
\item encoder is a continuous embedding from the source language to a $300$ dimensional space;
\item followed by a $3$-layers LSTM with a dropout;
\item the decoder has a stacked LSTM with a dropout, a global attention \citep{luong2015effective} and a continuous embedding from a $300$ dimensional space.
\end{itemize}

For each language pair a model was trained only on a {\tt 50K} parallel corpus with a {\tt 5\%} validation set.
Training on a NVIDIA Titan XP GPU usually lasted $20$ to $30$ minutes.
The results are provided in Table~\ref{table:results}.
Additionally, embeddings were trained with Fasttext~\citep{bojanowski2016enriching}.

On the {\tt Lv-En} langauge pair model performance was mediocre.
It could be explained by the fact that {\tt En-Ru} and {\tt En-Ko} were topic-resticted corpora - both were related to tourism only, while the {\tt Lv-En} corpora was extracted from a news feed which had no topic constraints.

\section{Unsupervised Neural Machine Translation}
\label{sect:unmt}

Competition included not only parallel corpus for each language pair but  {\tt 1M} monolingual corpus for each language.
One way to leverage this data is to use unsupervised \ac{NMT} model described in \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1711-00043}.
The code for this model is not available, so we built our own implementation~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/IlyaGusev/UNMT}} based on PyTorch framework. 

Our system can be used in several ways.
First, one can use it like an ordinary supervised \ac{NMT} system.
Second, it can work as a denoising autoencoder.
Finally, one can train this model on monolingual corpora using a predefined zero model.
There are two types of zero models which we have used: dictionary translation and a supervised model trained on a small corpora.
In any case, given a zero model, \ac{UNMT}~\footnote{The \ac{UNMT} model used for translation is described in \url{https://github.com/aoboturov/loresmt-nlprocessing\#unmt-model-description}} would train iteratively using adversarial training~\citep{goodfellow2016nips} with a discriminator~\footnote{The Discriminator description is available online \url{https://github.com/aoboturov/loresmt-nlprocessing\#unmt-discriminator-description}}.
The translation model is an RNN Encoder-Decoder architecture \citep{DBLP:journals/corr/ChoMGBSB14} with continuous embeddings and a global attention \citep{luong2015effective}.

\subsection{\ac{UNMT} with a dictionary translation zero model}
The dictionary translation model is a translation process which uses a dictionary obtained with an unsupervised embedding~\citep{conneau2017word} (or otherwise an external dictionary could have been used if the language pair was known) to translate each sentence word by word.

To debug the zero model we first check the input to output copy which is reported in Table~\ref{table:results} as the {\tt In to Out Copy} result.
Normally, we would expect an improvement over the {\tt In to Out Copy}, because it is closely related to dictionary translation: words which are not in the dictionary would be copied over from source to target sentences.

\todo{ao}{Run word-by-word separately to see the impact}

We do not know whether there is an error in our system or the corpora are too small.
BLEU scores on all language pairs were below {\tt 0.01 BLEU}.

\section{Prior Language Pair Information}
\label{sect:nonoblivious}

Competition was structured in a way to prevent participants from knowing what language pairs were being tested.
The Hackathon could have had any pair-combination of $42$ languages supported by {{Booking.com}}, so the total number of models (if trained undirectionally) would have been over $1500$.
Given that even for our simplest baseline model, an individual \ac{NMT} model is at least $300$~Megabytes, we would have had to train individual unidirectional models (likely multiple days) on some external parallel data (which we did not have for all language pairs) and package around half a Terabyte of data inside a docker container (which is technologically unrealistic).
We could have followed Google's \ac{NMT} approach~\citep{johnson2016google} or any other \ac{MT} approach, which have an intermediate neural representation, to reduce the total number of models to just one, but it still should have been trained on external parallel corpora (even if they all would be just English to any other of the $41$ languages).
To reduce the combinatorial complexity of the problem, one could somehow identify the language pair and then just train a single unidirectional model.
Competition testing system prevented access to any external resources and remote calls during training and inference phases.
The sheer size of models representations, the total training time, amount and diversity of training data and technical constraints would make pre-training a non-viable option.

The only information available to participants was the BLEU score and the failure or success status for the submission.
One could devise at least two attacks to identify the language pair and then using this prior knowledge, use it to consturct a better translation algorithm.

First we will explore the nature of those attacks and then measure what might be an impact of such knowledge.

\subsection{Side-Channel Attacks against the Language Pair}
\label{sect:attack}

We describe two ways how a language pair identification attack could be executed.

\subsubsection{Using Execution Time}

There is a way to identify the language pair in one submission by using the side-channel attack technique.
In this particular case, the side-channel would be the execution time of the translation algorithm whereby a language identification routine is run on each of the non-parallel corpora and both languages of the pair are detected.
Given that the routine could identify $N$ languages, all the pairs could be enumerated to define a mapping to natural numbers in range $1\dots N*(N-1)$.
Provided that a specific constant delay is used, one could divide the total execution time by the delay duration to obtain the index of the pair in the mapping.

\subsubsection{Using Failure Status}

The second way is a slower combinatorial way where a failure status is used as an indicator of the language belonging to a subset of languages being tested.
A set of all languages identifiable by the routine could be searched in log-time in a breadth search fashion descending only into subsets where we have established an inclusion relationship.

\subsection{Would Prior Knowledge Matter?}
\label{sect:prior}

In Table~\ref{table:results} we also report the best BLEU scores available within the conference submissions for each of the pairs trained on common corpora.

We could see that a margin of improvement is just a couple of BLEU points for {\tt En-Ru} and {\tt En-Ko} pairs.
On the other hand, {\tt Lv-En} has a very poor result and we would expect that both unsupervised learning and prior knowledge would improve this score.
%It would make sense to only investigate the {\tt Lv-En} further.

\section{Conclusion}

A generic fully unsupervised machine translation problem is hard.
In some cases, one could obtain good machine translation models by having a small data set for a limited domain, e.g. for a case of travelling destinations or some other domain-specific translation.
Although semi-supervised translation might improve the results, we have not observed that a fully supervised model used as the zero model for the \ac{UNMT} made any translation improvement over a regular supervised model.
Poor performance of the \ac{UNMT} has to be investigated further, possibly by providing larger non-parallel corpora and changing \ac{UNMT} model architecture.
